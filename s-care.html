    <h1>Why Self Care?</h1>
    <p class= "hey"> Self Care is so important and is way to oftern overlooked and forgotten. Some people may even feel guity taking time for themselves. But Self Care is crucial for personal development. Self Care affects all aspects of our life including Mental, Emotional, and Physical Health. We are more resilent for life's ups and downs when we take care of our body, mind, and soul. Self Care doesn't need to be grand or expensive, it can be as simple as taking a walk to clear you mind and sit in your own thoughts. “Self-care is never a selfish act—it is simply good stewardship of the only gift I have, the gift I was put on earth to offer to others.”
      – Parker Palmer
